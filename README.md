# Sailfish OS issue tracker

Please report issues to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker/issues) and use labels with issues.
You can filter by [labels](https://github.com/sailfishos/issue-tracker/labels).

Worth noting that Issue tracker provides a bug report template when creating a new issue.

## Traceability

Please remember to add the issue link to a pull request (or a commit message). By doing this, GitHub adds
the pull request / commit link to the issue. This is important from traceability point of view as occasionally
you need to find additional details regarding the issue being it review comments, why and how change implemented like
it is implemented, and so on. The reasoning is not always well documented in the commit message itself â€“ or hard to
elaborate briefly enough there. By doing like this one can see from the git history where to find more details. Similarly
from the issue you can directly jump to the change itself. If there happens to be a Forum Bug regarding the issue, it
would be good to link that as well to the pull request or to the commit message.

After a change is reviewed, Jolla Crew will take care of merging and integration.
